How to test your program

We have a test driver here, and a sample client that writes random guesses to the driver

If you are on Linux, take the binary (`driver` and `client/solver`).
If not, you might need to re-compile the source for your OS, please contact us for further instructions.

You can also test it by hand, just run your program, then enter data according to the specs
